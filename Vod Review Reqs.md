### FAQ to Know Before Reading the Requirments

**1. Why so many rules?**
	VOD reviews are meant to help you climb the ranks. These rules ensure that VODs are of players already familiar with their role and agent, maximizing learning potential.  

**2. How do I get my VOD reviewed?**
	1. Get your rank assigned in #üèÜÔ∏±rank-icon 
	2. Read, understand, and accept all rules in this channel.
	3. Submit your VOD to #vod-submission and if you are approved you can enter the raffles in #raffles-and-predictions on stream.

**3. What type of VOD is best to submit?**
	I prefer games with a close score line where you felt you performed well. Mistakes made in your good matches are mistakes you'll make in every match. 
	
**4. How much do VOD Reviews Cost? **
	VOD reviews have always been, and will always be completely free of charge. Starting January 10, 2023 all VODs must contain you typing "Good Luck" in all chat in round 1 to show you have read all of the VOD review requirements. Discord subscribers get extra tickets for increased odds to win raffles, but anyone can win at any time. See [https://discord.com/channels/915336728707989534/role-subscriptions](https://discord.com/channels/915336728707989534/role-subscriptions "https://discord.com/channels/915336728707989534/role-subscriptions") for the exact details of the subscription benefits. 
	
 **5. Can I submit a vod in another language?**
 Yes! VODs can be submitted in any language as long as you are able to translate comms into English if asked during stream. 
 
	

### VOD Requirements 
**1. You Must Communicate In Game**
Attempted pre-round plans are required. 
- Example of acceptable pre-round plan: "Phoenix, I'll put this cage up for you to flash out of if they push us."
- NOT acceptable pre-round plan: "Let's all go to A."

	There is too much lost value in games where you are not communicating, and this makes the coaching experience far less valuable. Comm‚Äôing only with your duo in Discord does not count. 
	
**2. No Filling**
	No Fill VODs or trackers with excessive filling.  We consider filling playing more than 1 agent per map. 
	If you are immortal+ a second role is acceptable. This requirement is to make sure that your VOD review is not spent covering the basics of your role/agent if you are not playing them enough. 

**3. You Must Play Consistently.**
		In order to get effective vod review you should be playing consistently. We are requiring that 11 of the last 14 days show competitive gameplay on your tracker.gg profile. This is to ensure that the advice you get can (1) be useful to you when you win a raffle, and (2) ensure that the vods being reviewed on stream are of the highest quality. If you only play once every 2 weeks you won't be able to implement the advice effectively.
		
		We will take into account things like holidays if they interfere.
		
**4. Minimap must be uncovered**
	Your minimap cannot be hidden  (Ex: most twitch streamers hide their minimap)
	
**5. No Music.**
    No Music is allowed, DMCA strikes are too risky.
    
**6. Other Non-Allowed Things
No Astra Allowed Below Immortal**

    
### DUOS / TRIOS / 5-STACKS
    
**1. Can I submit a Ranked game where I'm playing with friends?** 
	Duo/Trio queue is fine if your duo/trio are not significantly better/worse than you. For 5stack, please see the message under this one. 
	
**2. Can I submit a 5-stack VOD?** 
	All five members of the team must be members of the discord for at least a week and found in #üë™Ô∏±lf-5stack. You will be required to ping them in stream chat when your vod is reviewed. All other vod review rules still apply. No scrims.

	
### TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQ EXPLANATIONS

**1. Why can't I accept the vod review rules?** 
You must have your rank role assigned in the server to ensure you are Gold+. Head over to #üèÜÔ∏±rank-icon. If you have issues, please DM @MOD MAIL for assistance. 

**2. Why don't you review Reyna?** 

This is a personal restriction. I believe Reyna is a feast or famine agent that is heavily lacking in strong utility. She relies on your personal ability to frag out; and my coaching style is the opposite of this. My coaching will help you rank up even if you're a weak fragger. On the flipside, I'm not the best at teaching people how to frag out, so Reyna is a very bad fit for me. 

**3. Why no Astra for lower than immortal?** 

Astra is an incredibly complicated agent and relies far too much on your teammates to be truly effective. Below immortal you are always better off playing other controllers.

**4. Why no vods under Gold?**
	The game doesn't really start until you reach gold. Under that rank you should simply focus on your mechanics, lock reyna and frag out. I have created a practice routine that can be found here: https://youtu.be/9KIoTtohkOQ
